# HTMLogs
This project is designed to help with the implementation of html logs in any project. The log is presented as an object with its own interaction functions. The repository also contains a file with log templates, which should help with the implementation.

## Usage
To use this lib you have to include `htmlogs.h` into your project. To use log templates include `htmlogs_templates.h`.

## Building from source
Download this repository with

```
git clone https://github.com/nerett/htmlogs.git
```

Then build `htmlogs.cpp` (and `htmlogs_templates.cpp` if you use log templates) and link it to your project.
